# Auth-worker Contributing Guide

Hi! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Auth-worker. Before submitting your contribution though, please make sure to take a moment and read through the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as well as the appropriate section for the contribution you intend to make:

-   [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
-   [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

-   The issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests.
-   Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version.
-   It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.
-   Use only the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce the unexpected behavior.

## Pull Request Guidelines

-   If adding new feature:
    -   Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
-   If fixing a bug,provide detailed description of the bug in the PR, or link to an issue that does.
